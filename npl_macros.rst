Macros
======

Macros are a way of reusing code.
If you have several rules or facts
that share a common form,
you can put that common form in a macro definition,
and provide the special parts as parameters
when you call the macro.

for an example, see
`this npl test <https://github.com/enriquepablo/nl/blob/master/nl/npl_tests/lists.npl>`_

the actual grammar is in
`this module <https://github.com/enriquepablo/nl/blob/master/nl/nlc/preprocessor.py>`_
